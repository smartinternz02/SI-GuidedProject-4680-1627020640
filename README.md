# project:-Predicting and Analyzing urban Water quality using Machine Learning
We have to predict the water quality index(wqi) by using the input variables in UI. By using water quality index we can predict whether the water is contaminated or not. Hence wqi is the output column to be predicted. The index ranges from 1 to 100; a higher number indicates better water quality.
